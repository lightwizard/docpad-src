<p> It is impossible to transcribe the grandeur of Eric Cooper's work on a two dimensional webpage. We started this website because we felt a strong desire to make Eric's work available to the collective memory of human civilization. The Internet. It has a wonderful power of compressing time and distances into a single click. This power  exponentially multiply the innate nature of the Art - to be an island of inspiration in our mundane lives. </p>

<p>Our hope is that you feel the same inspiration and can take it to your own line of work.</p>
